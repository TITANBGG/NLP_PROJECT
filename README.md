# NLP_PROJECT
NLP-Based Translation App Project
This project focuses on developing a Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based translation application designed to convert text from one language to another with a focus on context and accuracy. The goal was to enhance the quality of machine translations by applying advanced NLP techniques to understand sentence structure, grammar, and semantics.

Key Features:
Contextual Translation: Leverages NLP models to provide translations that maintain the context of the original sentence rather than performing word-for-word translations.
Multi-Language Support: Capable of translating between multiple languages with a focus on ensuring linguistic correctness.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface allowing users to input text and receive translations efficiently.
Machine Learning Integration: Utilizes trained models to improve translation quality based on sentence structure and context.
This project helped me deepen my understanding of natural language processing, machine translation, and how to apply language models to real-world applications.
